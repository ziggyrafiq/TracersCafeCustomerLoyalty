## Overview
The project "TracersCafeCustomerLoyalty" aims to develop a module that manages customer information as part of Tracer's Cafe loyalty cards. Up to 1000 customer details can be captured and stored in this module, including title, first name, surname, address, postcode, telephone, and age. The application allows users to view all customers, add new ones, edit or delete existing entries, and display all customers. The project will utilize MVC, Entity Framework, and HTML, which will require research and understanding.
